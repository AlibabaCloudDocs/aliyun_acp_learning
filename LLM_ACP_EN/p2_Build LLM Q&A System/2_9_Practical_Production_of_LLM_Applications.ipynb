    "\n",
    "## 🚄 Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "Through previous course modules, your **Question-Answering Bot** (QAB) has already demonstrated proficiency in addressing **domain-specific knowledge** queries. This section will further explore the critical process of deploying LLM applications into **production environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning from development and testing phases to real-world business scenarios involves a complex, multi-dimensional workflow requiring rigorous technical considerations. We will systematically break down these components to ensure successful operationalization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 🍁 Goals\n",
    "Upon completing this module, you will be equipped to:\n",
    "- **Identify key deployment factors** for LLM applications in production through business requirement analysis\n",
    "- **Optimize cost-performance trade-offs** in LLM application operations\n",
    "- **Enhance system stability** and reliability for LLM-powered solutions"

    "Deploying LLMs into production environments and applying them to real-world business scenarios is no easy task. It requires a comprehensive approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start from the **business context**\n",
    "2. Select the most suitable model based on **functional requirements** (such as choosing Qwen-Math for math-heavy tasks)\n",
    "3. Consider **non-functional requirements** like performance, cost, security, and stability\n",
    "\n",
    "While functional requirements define *what* the LLM does, non-functional requirements ensure *how well* it performs—directly impacting system quality, user experience, and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only by balancing business needs with technical implementation can you deploy and operate LLM services efficiently and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers these core topics, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to deploy LLMs in real-world scenarios in a cost-effective, stable, and scalable manner. The next lesson will delve deeper into building robust compliance and security defenses for LLM applications."

    "## 1. Business requirements analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Business requirements analysis is the first step toward successfully deploying LLMs. Different business scenarios exhibit significant variations in both functional and non-functional requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unclear business scenario may lead to:\n",
    "- **Model selection errors**: Choosing a model unsuitable for a specific task, resulting in poor performance or resource waste\n",
    "- **Degraded user experience**: Failure to meet expectations on latency, accuracy, or consistency\n",
    "- **Uncontrolled costs**: Suboptimal deployment strategies due to misalignment with business needs\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, after clearly defining the business scenario, conduct an in-depth analysis centered on both functional and non-functional requirements, then formulate a concrete deployment strategy."

    "### 1.1 Functional requirements of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Different business scenarios impose distinct functional requirements on models. Below are model selection recommendations for several typical task scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Natural language processing (NLP)\n",
    "One of the most common LLM application areas, including:\n",
    "- Question answering systems\n",
    "- Text generation\n",
    "- Translation\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "| Task Type | Recommended Model |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **General-purpose NLP** | General LLMs (such as Qwen, GPT, DeepSeek) |\n",
    "| **Mathematical reasoning** | Domain-optimized models (such as Qwen-Math) |\n",
    "| **Legal consultation** | Legal-domain models (such as Tongyi LawR) |\n",
    "| **Medical diagnosis** | Medical-specialized models + knowledge graphs or rule engines |\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Note**: For high-stakes domains like healthcare and law, combine LLMs with structured knowledge bases to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vision tasks\n",
    "Includes image classification, object detection, and image generation. These typically require **dedicated vision models**, not general LLMs:\n",
    "- **Image generation**: Tongyi Wanxiang, Stable Diffusion\n",
    "- **Object detection**: YOLO series\n",
    "- **Visual understanding**: Qwen-VL\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1.2 Non-functional requirements of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying a model into production, beyond functional suitability, you must evaluate **non-functional requirements**—critical factors that determine system quality and operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "- **Performance**: latency, throughput\n",
    "- **Cost**: inference, training, API usage\n",
    "- **Stability**: availability, error rate, failover\n",
    "- **Scalability**: handling traffic spikes\n",
    "- **Security & Compliance**: data privacy, access control\n",
