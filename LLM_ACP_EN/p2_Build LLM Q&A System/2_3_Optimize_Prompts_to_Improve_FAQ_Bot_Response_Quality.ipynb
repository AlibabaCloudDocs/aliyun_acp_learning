        "Through studying this section, you've mastered more advanced techniques in **Context Engineering**, from designing fine-grained prompts to implementing intelligent intent routing. Looking back at the past two sections, we've equipped the Q&A bot with two core capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Knowledge Filling (via RAG)**: Solved the problem of the model \"not knowing\" private information.\n",
        "2. **Behavior Guidance (via Prompts and Control Flow)**: Solved the problems of \"how to do\" and \"what to do\" for the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The common core of these techniques is the essence of context engineering:\n",
        "\n",
        "By carefully designing and filling the model's context window to guide and control its generation of desired outputs—this is crucial for you to use LLMs effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the actual process of deploying LLM applications, the prompt part is often co-designed with domain experts. Therefore, instead of hardcoding prompts in your engineering code, you should consider making them configurable—even the application workflow can be configurable. This makes it easier for domain experts to participate in designing prompts and the entire workflow. Alibaba Cloud Model Studio provides visual [application building](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/user-guide/application-introduction#7c79befb2djg9) capabilities, allowing prompt writing and visual construction of the entire complex application workflow on the page—very suitable for LLM application development projects that require participation from domain experts without technical backgrounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, you'll learn automated evaluation methods to test the Q&A bot's performance. You can use quantitative metrics to evaluate the optimization effects you've achieved through context engineering.\n"
