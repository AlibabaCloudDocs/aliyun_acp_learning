        "Through  this section, you have gained a solid understanding of prompting techniques for both general LLMs and reasoning LLMs. The flexible application of these techniques ensures a baseline level of quality in AI-generated responses. However, as AI technology continues to evolve, these methods may also change—such as when reasoning models no longer require chain-of-thought prompting to achieve optimal performance.What’s most important to understand is that the core purpose of prompt engineering remains the same: to clearly express your core needs and provide rich, relevant background information (context). This is essential for effectively leveraging LLMs and ensuring they deliver accurate, meaningful results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In real-world LLM applications, domain experts often play a key role in designing prompts. Therefore, hardcoding prompts directly into your code should be avoided. Instead, consider making prompts configurable or even building an entirely configurable application workflow. This allows domain experts—especially those without technical backgrounds—to actively participate in refining prompts and shaping the overall process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alibaba Cloud's Model Studio offers a powerful application building capability, enabling users to write prompts and visually design complex application flows directly on the platform. This makes it an ideal tool for LLM projects that involve collaboration with non-technical domain experts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section, you will learn about automated evaluation methods to assess the performance of Q&A bots. You’ll explore how to use quantitative metrics to measure the effectiveness of your prompts and continuously improve your AI-driven applications."
