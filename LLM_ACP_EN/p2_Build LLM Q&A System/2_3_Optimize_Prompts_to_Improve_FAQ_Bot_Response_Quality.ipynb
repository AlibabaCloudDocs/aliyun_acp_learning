        "In Section 4.5, you learned how to improve response quality by using the chain-of-thought (CoT)technique with LLMs. However, for reasoning models, it is generally unnecessary to prompt them with phrases like \"think step by step\" or \"explain your reasoning.\" These models are designed to perform deep thinking naturally. Adding such instructions may actually limit their performance unless you specifically need the model to follow a strict reasoning path, which is uncommon.\n",

This makes it easier for you to refine prompts based on the model's output. You don’t need to worry about whether your initial prompt is perfect—simply continue engaging with the model, providing additional information, and refining your prompts during the conversation.\n",

        "For example, if your descriptions are too abstract or not accurately described, you can use the technique of adding examples, as discussed in Section 4.4, to clarify the task. These examples can often be drawn from previous interactions with the model.This iterative process can be repeated multiple times, continuously adjusting prompts and allowing the model to refine its reasoning until it meets your expectations.\n",

However, as AI technology continues to evolve, these methods may also change—such as when reasoning models no longer require chain-of-thought prompting to achieve optimal performance.What’s most important to understand is that the core purpose of prompt engineering remains the same: to clearly express your core needs and provide rich, relevant background information (context). This is essential for effectively leveraging LLMs and ensuring they deliver accurate, meaningful results.\n",

Instead, consider making prompts configurable or even building an entirely configurable application workflow. This allows domain experts—especially those without technical backgrounds—to actively participate in refining prompts and shaping the overall process.\n",
