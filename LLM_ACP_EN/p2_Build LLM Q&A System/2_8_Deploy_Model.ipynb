        "\n",
        "Model deployment refers to moving a trained AI model from the development environment into production, enabling it to process real-time data and serve actual users‚Äîthereby creating practical value.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you reviewed in Sections 2.1 to 2.6, you‚Äôve already invoked models multiple times (such as `qwq-32b` and `qwen-plus`). However, you didn‚Äôt deploy these models yourself. Instead, you used pre-deployed models provided by Alibaba Cloud, which are hosted on their servers and accessible via API.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several advantages to directly invoking fully managed API services like those provided by Alibaba Cloud:\n",
        "* **Direct invocation**: No need for manual deployment‚Äîjust call the API.\n",
        "* **Pay-as-you-go billing**: You‚Äôre charged based on token usage, avoiding upfront costs and idle GPU resource waste.\n",
        "* **No operational overhead**: Tasks like scaling, monitoring, and model version upgrades are handled automatically by the service provider.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach is ideal for¬†early-stage businesses or small- to medium-scale scenarios, helping reduce initial investment and simplify operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: Direct model invocation is typically subject to \"[rate limiting](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/rate-limit)\" For example, when using the Model Studio API, there are limits on the number of calls per minute (QPM) and tokens per minute (TPM). Exceeding these limits will result in failed requests until the rate limit resets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, if your use case requires a custom fine-tuned model that isn't supported by the provider's API, direct invocation may not meet your needs."
